# LMP GUI

**LMP GUI** is Python application for **Assetto Corsa** displaying all essential information for LMP drivers in one place (it works with other cars as well). My inspiration was HUD I have seen on Youtube videos of iRacing 24 Hours of Le Mans. To be honest I don't know if is it mod or default HUD, because I have never played iRacing. Not all features coincide, and both applications significantly differ, but layout is similar. As far as I know it does not work for Assetto Corsa Competezione, but I have not tried it.
